hipchat-sns-bridge
=================================

To get your AWS (Auto-scaling, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, etc.) notifications into a Hipchat room, you need an SNS topic and some sort of subscriber.
This app will act as a subscriber, adding a little sugar before calling hipchat, such as adding colour etc.
